# Ikeouf_Integration

This project is an integration project, using only html/css with a little bit of js (but not too much).

## Introduction

The module "Integration" was the first module of my Epitech's Coding Academy course, after the PHP Pool. It was a group project.

The instruction was to recode the entire homepage of a fake website, based on a picture (desktop and mobile version). You can check the two pictures in this repo, named "Instruction 1" and "Instruction 2".

## Restrictions

As it was an integration project, the goal was to code on scratch a webpage, so we did not had the right to use frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Even flexbox was not the right choice, they wanted us to discover the Grid CSS.

The project hasn't to be effective, so we also didn't had the right to use js, except for one or two elements not enable on html (like the price range with two inputs).

We had two (2) days to do this project. **This repo has my own project, as I recode it on my own after the Coding Academy's course.**
