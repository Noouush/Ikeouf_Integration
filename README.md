# Ikeouf_Integration

This project is an integration project, using only html/css with a little bit of js (but not too much).

## Introduction

The module "Integration" was the first module of my Epitech's Coding Academy course, after the PHP Pool. It was a group project.

The instruction was to recode the entire homepage of a fake website, based on a picture (desktop and mobile version). You can check the two pictures in this repo, named "Instruction1" and "Instruction2".

## Restrictions ⛔️

As it was an integration project, the goal was to code on scratch a webpage, so we did not had the right to use frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Even flexbox was not the right choice, they wanted us to discover the Grid CSS.

The project hasn't to be effective, so we also didn't had the right to use js, except for one or two elements not enable on html (like the price range with two inputs).

We had two (2) days to do this project. **This repo has my own project, as I recode it on my own after the Coding Academy's course.**



## Details and issues

No installation needed, every file needed for the code is in the repository.



### jQuery and JS

I used some jQuery for the price range, even if it's recommended to not use jQuery, because every codes and help I founded on internet would have forced me to use too much JS for the project.



### Grid System

The grid system used do not has grid template area, because it didn't worked on my solo project, even if it worked on my group project. I didn't understand why, and I put my code on the W3C Validator, which told me everthing was good.
So no grid-template-areas, but grid-template-columns and rows.

### Responsive

We also had to insure that our project would be responsive. I worked on it but I had a few issues. I succeeded to make my project responsive on almost all the website, except the menu, where i couldn't manage to put a burger menu with an opening menu tab. Visually, the menu is good, but the nav doesn't work, we only have the burger icon. It's something I can rework with JS onclick, and I'll rework it later.

### Screenshots

You can se the screenshots of my work on the "screenshots" directory. It's called "MyWork1" and "MyWork2".
